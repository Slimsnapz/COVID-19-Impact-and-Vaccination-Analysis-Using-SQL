## Project Title: Analyzing COVID-19 Impact and Vaccination Rates Using SQL <br>

## Description:<br>
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact and vaccination progress across various countries, with a focus on Nigeria. The project utilizes SQL to extract, analyze, and visualize key insights from large datasets on COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations.

## Key Skills and Techniques Used:<br>

**SQL**: Employed to perform complex queries, joins, and calculations to derive meaningful insights from the data.<br>
**Python**: Utilized for data manipulation, loading datasets into SQL databases, and integrating SQL queries into a Jupyter Notebook environment.<br>
**Data Analysis**: Conducted detailed analysis to calculate death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination progress over time.<br>
**Data Visualization**: Used libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual representation of trends and patterns.<br>
**Database Management**: Leveraged SQLite for managing the COVID-19 data and executing queries.<br>
**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Applied to simplify complex queries and improve readability.<br>
**Rolling Calculations**: Implemented rolling sums to track the cumulative number of vaccinations across time.<br>
## Processes:<br>

**Data Preparation**: Loaded COVID-19 death and vaccination datasets, and saved them as SQL tables.<br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed and visualized initial data to understand trends and identify key areas of interest.<br>
**SQL Queries**: Created multiple SQL queries to extract insights, including infection rates, death percentages, and vaccination progress.<br>
**Advanced SQL Techniques**: Utilized window functions and CTEs for advanced data analysis, such as calculating rolling vaccination counts.<br>
**Reporting**: Summarized findings through clear and concise queries that highlight significant COVID-19 metrics globally and for specific regions.<br>
## Outcome:<br>
This project successfully demonstrates the power of SQL in handling large datasets and extracting meaningful insights related to global health events. The results include key metrics on COVID-19's impact and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns across different countries and continents.


## Dataset<br>
The project uses two main datasets:<br>

COVID-19 Deaths Dataset: Contains information on the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population data across various countries.<br>
COVID-19 Vaccinations Dataset: Includes data on the number of vaccinations administered globally.<br>
## Key Features<br>
Data Exploration: Initial exploration and visualization of the datasets to identify key areas of analysis.<br>
SQL-Based Analysis: Detailed SQL queries to calculate metrics such as:<br>
Percentage of deaths relative to total cases.<br>
Percentage of the population infected by COVID-19.<br>
Countries with the highest infection rates and death counts.<br>
Rolling vaccination totals and vaccination percentages relative to population.<br>
Advanced SQL Techniques: Use of window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and joins to perform complex data manipulations and analyses.<br>
Insights on Nigeria: Specific focus on analyzing the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria, including infection rates and vaccination progress.<br>
## Technologies Used<br>
Python: For data preprocessing and integration with SQL.<br>
SQLite: As the database management system to store and query the datasets.<br>
Pandas: For data manipulation before loading into SQL.<br>
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting results.<br>
